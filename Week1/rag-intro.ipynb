Some institutions allow late enrollment within a certain timeframe, while others may not.\\n\\n2. **Contact the Instructor:** Reach out to the course instructor directly via email or during their office hours. Explain your situation and ask if it’s possible to join the class late.\\n\\n3. **Consult the Registrar:** Contact the registrar’s office or the student services department at your institution. They can provide guidance on the administrative aspects of late enrollment.\\n\\n4. **Review Course Requirements:** Make sure you understand the course requirements and catch up on any missed materials. You might need to put in extra effort to cover what you missed.\\n\\n5. **Consider the Workload:** Assess whether you can handle the additional workload to catch up. Some courses have a fast pace, and missing the first few classes could put you at a significant disadvantage.\\n\\nIf you receive permission to enroll late, make sure to get any necessary paperwork completed as soon as possible.\""

Docker images should first all be up and running.section: Workshop 1 - dlthub\\nquestion: How do I install the necessary dependencies to run the code?\\nanswer: Answer: To run the provided code, ensure that the \\'dlt[duckdb]\\' package is installed. You can do this by executing the provided installation command: !pip install dlt[duckdb]. If you’re doing it locally, be sure to also have duckdb pip installed (even before the duckdb package is loaded).section: Module 6: streaming with kafka\\nquestion: Python Kafka: ./build.sh: Permission denied Error\\nanswer: Run this command in terminal in the same directory (/docker/spark):\\nchmod +x build.shsection: Project\\nquestion: How to fix the error \"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \\'kafka.vendor.six.moves\\'\"?\\nanswer: According to https://github.com/dpkp/kafka-python/\\n“DUE TO ISSUES WITH RELEASES, IT IS SUGGESTED TO USE https://github.com/wbarnha/kafka-python-ng FOR THE TIME BEING”\\nUse pip install kafka-python-ng insteadsection: Module 6: streaming with kafka\\nquestion: kafka.errors.NoBrokersAvailable: NoBrokersAvailable\\nanswer: If you have this error, it most likely that your kafka broker docker container is not working.\\nUse docker ps to confirm\\nThen in the docker compose yaml file folder, run docker compose up -d to start all the instances.section: Module 6: streaming with kafka\\nquestion: Python Kafka: ./spark-submit.sh streaming.py - How to check why Spark master connection fails\\nanswer: Start a new terminal\\nRun: docker ps\\nCopy the CONTAINER ID of the spark-master container\\nRun: docker exec -it <spark_master_container_id> bash\\nRun: cat logs/spark-master.out\\nCheck for the log when the error happened\\nGoogle the error message from theresection: Module 6: streaming with kafka\\nquestion: How do I check compatibility of local and container Spark versions?\\nanswer: You can check the version of your local spark using spark-submit --version. In the build.sh file of the Python folder, make sure that SPARK_VERSION matches your local version. Similarly, make sure the pyspark you pip installed also matches this version.section: Module 6: streaming with kafka\\nquestion: Python Kafka: Installing dependencies for python3 06-streaming/python/avro_example/producer.py\\nanswer: confluent-kafka: `pip install confluent-kafka` or `conda install conda-forge::python-confluent-kafka`\\nfastavro: pip install fastavro\\nAbhirup Ghosh\\nCan install Faust Library for Module 6 Python Version due to dependency conflicts?\\nThe Faust repository and library is no longer maintained - https://github.com/robinhood/faust\\nIf you do not know Java, you now have the option to follow the Python Videos 6.13 & 6.14 here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgAlVknDFlQ&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=80  and follow the RedPanda Python version here https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/06-streaming/python/redpanda_example - NOTE: I highly recommend watching the Java videos to understand the concept of streaming but you can skip the coding parts - all will become clear when you get to the Python videos and RedPanda files.section: General course-related questions\\nquestion: How do I use Git / GitHub for this course?\\nanswer: After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub\\nHaving this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\\nYou will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\\nRemember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\\nThis is also a great resource: https://dangitgit.com/'"
